@title{Arrays}

All computation in array-oriented programming is performed on arrays. An array
is a collection of ``atoms'' arranged in a rectangular, or ``regular'', layout.
Atoms are basic data such as numbers, strings, and booleans.

An array can have any natural number of @tech[#:key "axis" #:normalize? #f]{axes}.
This number is called the array's ``rank.''
A vector extends along only one axis, so it is a rank 1 array.
A matrix has two axes, making it a rank 2 array.
This rule generalizes to higher-rank structures, though they do not have common names.
The degenerate case of an array has zero axes---a scalar has rank 0
(note: a scalar contains one atom, but an atom is not itself a scalar).

The ``shape'' of an array is a sequence whose elements gives the array's size
along each axis. For example, a 4 × 7 matrix (4 rows, 7 columns) has shape
@code[#:lang "remora/dynamic"]{[4 7]}, whereas an individual row in that matrix
has shape @code[#:lang "remora/dynamic"]{[7]}. Five such matrices could be
collected into an array with shape @code[#:lang "remora/dynamic"]{[5 4 7]}.
Regularity requires that each plane in this 5 × 4 × 7 array have four rows and
that each of those rows have seven entries. A scalar (recall, rank 0 array) must
have the empty sequence @code[#:lang "remora/dynamic"]{[]} as its shape.

The product of an array's dimensions gives the number of ``atoms'' the array
contains. Our 4 × 7 matrix contains 28 atoms. For a scalar, this product is
1, the empty product, so a scalar contains one atom.

Expressions in @racket{#lang remora/dynamic} produce arrays, and variables can
only be bound to arrays. As a syntactic convenience, atoms in expression
position are converted to scalar array literals.


@defform[(alit (natural ...) atom ...)]{
Array literal: Produces an array of the given atoms arranged according
to the given shape, @code[#:lang "remora/dynamic"]{[natural ...]}.

The 2 × 3 matrix whose rows are @code[#:lang "remora/dynamic"]{[1 0 2]} and
@code[#:lang "remora/dynamic"]{[3 2 1]} can be described with the array literal
@code[#:lang "remora/dynamic"]{(alit (3 2) 1 0 2 3 2 1)}.

@;{TODO: variables are rendering weird in 'code' fragments}
In @tt{#lang remora/dynamic},
@code[#:lang "remora/dynamic"]{#A(dimension ...)(atom ...)}
is read as @racket[(alit (dimension ...) atom ...)], so the above example can
be written @code[#:lang "remora/dynamic"]{#A(3 2)(1 0 2 3 2 1)}.
}

@defform[(vec expr ...+)]{
Array constructor: All @code[#:lang "remora/dynamic"]{expr}s must evaluate to
arrays with the same shape. The number of fragments given is prepended to the
fragments' shape to form the resulting array's shape. If there are no fragments,
the resulting array has shape @code[#:lang "remora/dynamic"]{[0]}. The resulting
array contains the concatenated contents of the given fragments. This form is
more flexible than @code[#:lang "remora/dynamic"]{alit} as atoms which appear in
expression position are automatically promoted to scalars.

@code[#:lang "remora/dynamic"]{(vec (alit (3) 1 0 2) (alit (3) 3 2 1))} and
@code[#:lang "remora/dynamic"]{(vec (vec 1 0 2) (vec 3 2 1))} both produce the
same 2 × 3 matrix as @code[#:lang "remora/dynamic"]{(alit (3 2) 1 0 2 3 2 1)}.
}

@defform[(array fragment ...+)]{
"Smart" constructor: If the fragments are atoms, this form becomes a rank 1
@racket[alit] form whose sole dimension is the number of atoms given. If the
fragments are non-atoms, this form expands to a @racket[vec] form.

In @tt{#lang remora/dynamic}, @tt{[expr ...]} is read as
@racket[(array expr ...)]
}

@defform[(define id expr)]{
Definition form: binds @racket[id] to the result of @code{expr}. Recall that
expressions produce arrays, so @code{(define x 3)} binds @code{x} to the scalar
@code[#:lang "remora/dynamic"]{#A()(3)}, not the atom 3. Therefore
@code[#:lang "remora/dynamic"]{[x x]} produces
@code[#:lang "remora/dynamic"]{#A(2)(3 3)}, and
@code[#:lang "remora/dynamic"]{#A(2)(x x)} is not permitted.
}
@defform[(def id expr)]{
Like @racket[define], but available in library mode,
to avoid shadowing issues with the "ambient" language.
}
